*STATIC
</h2>
<p>
Keyword type: step

<p>
This procedure is used to perform a static analysis. The load consists of the
sum of the load of the last *STATIC step and the load specified in the present
step with replacement of redefined loads.

<p>
There are five optional parameters: SOLVER, DIRECT, EXPLICIT, TIME RESET and
TOTAL TIME AT START. SOLVER determines the
package used to solve the ensuing system of equations. The following solvers
can be selected:

<p>
<ul>
<li>the SGI solver
</li>
<li>PaStiX 
</li>
<li>PARDISO
</li>
<li>SPOOLES [<a href="node504.html#Ashcraft1">3</a>,<a href="node504.html#Ashcraft2">4</a>]. 
</li>
<li>TAUCS 
</li>
<li>the iterative solver by Rank and Ruecker [<a href="node504.html#Rank">70</a>], which is based on
  the algorithms by Schwarz [<a href="node504.html#Schwarz">76</a>]. 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Default is the first solver which has been installed of the following list:
SGI, PaStiX, PARDISO, SPOOLES and TAUCS. If none is installed, the default is the iterative solver, which comes with the CalculiX
package.

<p>
The SGI solver should by now be considered as outdated.SPOOLES is very fast, but has no
out-of-core capability: the size of systems you can solve is limited by your
RAM memory. With 32GB of RAM you can solve up to 1,000,000 equations.  TAUCS is
also good, but my experience is limited to the <span class="MATH"><b><img align="BOTTOM" alt="$ LL^T$" border="0" height="17" src="img2018.png" width="35"/></b></span> decomposition, which
only applies to positive definite systems. It has an out-of-core capability
and also offers a <span class="MATH"><b><img align="BOTTOM" alt="$ LU$" border="0" height="16" src="img2019.png" width="27"/></b></span> decomposition, however, I was not able to run either of
them so far. PARDISO is the Intel proprietary solver and is about a factor of
two faster than SPOOLES. The most recent solver we tried is the freeware
solver PaStiX from INRIA. It is
really fast and can use the GPU. For large problems and a high end Nvidea graphical
 card (32 GB of RAM) we got an acceleration of a factor between 3 and 8
 compared to PARDISO. We modified PaStiX for this, therefore you have to
 download PaStiX from our website and compile it for your system. This can be
 slightly tricky, however, it is worth it!

<p>
What about the iterative solver? If SOLVER=ITERATIVE SCALING is
selected, the pre-conditioning is limited to a scaling of the diagonal terms,
SOLVER=ITERATIVE CHOLESKY triggers Incomplete Cholesky
pre-conditioning. Cholesky pre-conditioning leads to a better convergence and
maybe to shorter execution times, however, it requires additional storage
roughly corresponding to the non-zeros in the matrix. If you are short of
memory, diagonal scaling might be your last resort. The iterative methods
perform well for truly three-dimensional structures. For instance,
calculations for a hemisphere were about nine times faster with the ITERATIVE
SCALING solver, and three times faster with the ITERATIVE CHOLESKY solver than
with SPOOLES. For two-dimensional structures such as plates or shells, the
performance might break down drastically and convergence often requires the
use of Cholesky pre-conditioning. SPOOLES (and any of the other direct solvers)
performs well in most situations with emphasis on slender structures but
requires much more storage than the iterative solver.

<p>
The parameter DIRECT is relevant for nonlinear calculations only, and
indicates that automatic incrementation should be switched off.

<p>
The parameter EXPLICIT is only important for fluid computations. If present,
the fluid computation is explicit, else it is semi-implicit. Static structural
computations are always implicit.

<p>
The parameter TIME RESET can be used to force the total time at the
end of the present step to coincide with the total time at the end of the
previous step. If there is no previous step the targeted total time is
zero. If this parameter is absent the total time at the end of the present step is the
total time at the end of the previous step plus the time period of the present
step (2nd parameter underneath the *STATIC keyword). Consequently, if the time
at the end of the previous step is 10. and the present time period is 1., the
total time at the end of the present step is 11. If the TIME RESET parameter
is used, the total time at the beginning of the present step is 9. and at the
end of the present step it will be 10. This is sometimes useful if
thermomechanical calculations are split into transient heat transfer steps
followed by quasi-static static steps (this can be faster than using the
*COUPLED TEMPERATURE-DISPLACEMENT option, which forces the same amount of
iterations for the thermal as for the mechanical calculations and than using
the *UNCOUPLED TEMPERATURE-DISPLACEMENT option, which forces the same amount
of increments for the thermal as for the mechanical calculations). In CalculiX the static step needs a
finite time period, however, the user frequently does not want the quasi-static
step to change the time count.

<p>
Finally, the parameter TOTAL TIME AT START can be used to set the total time
at the start of the step to a specific value.

<p>
In a static step, loads are by default applied in a linear way. Other loading
patterns can be defined by an <a href="node213.html#amplitude">*AMPLITUDE</a> card.

<p>
If nonlinearities are present in the model (geometric nonlinearity or material
nonlinearity), the solution is obtained through iteration. Since the step may
be too large to obtain convergence, a subdivision of the step in increments is
usually necessary. The user can define the length of the initial
increment. This size is kept constant if the parameter DIRECT is selected,
else it is varied by CalculiX according to the convergence properties of the
solution. In a purely linear calculation the step size is always 1., no
iterations are performed and, consequently, no second line underneath *STATIC
is needed. 

<p>
Notice that any creep behavior (e.g. by using the keyword
<a href="node243.html#creep">*CREEP</a>) is switched off in a *STATIC step. To include creep
use the <a href="node350.html#visco">*VISCO</a> keyword. The syntax for both keywords is the same.

<p><p>

<p>
First line:

<ul>
<li>*STATIC
</li>
<li>Enter any needed parameters and their values.
</li>
</ul>
Second line (only relevant for nonlinear analyses; for linear analyses, the
step length is always 1)

<ul>
<li>Initial time increment. This value will be modified due to automatic incrementation, unless the parameter DIRECT was specified (default 1.).
</li>
<li>Time period of the step (default 1.).
</li>
<li>Minimum time increment allowed. Only active if DIRECT is not specified. Default is the initial time increment or 1.e-5 times the time period of the step, whichever is smaller.
</li>
<li>Maximum time increment allowed. Only active if DIRECT is not specified. Default is 1.e+30.
</li>
<li>Initial time increment for CFD applications (default 1.e-2)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<pre>
Example:

*STATIC,DIRECT
.1,1.
</pre>
<p>
defines a static step and selects the SPOOLES solver as linear equation solver in the step (default). If the step is a linear one, the other parameters are of no importance. If the step is nonlinear, the second line indicates that the initial time increment is .1 and the total step time is 1. Furthermore, the parameter DIRECT leads to a fixed time increment. Thus, if successful, the calculation consists of 10 increments of length 0.1.
