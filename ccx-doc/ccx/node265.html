<p>
Keyword type: step

<p>
This option is used to save selected element variables averaged at the nodal
points in a frd file (extension .frd) for subsequent viewing by CalculiX
GraphiX. The following element variables can be selected (the label is square
brackets [] is the one used in the .frd file; for frequency calculations with
cyclic symmetry both a real and an imaginary part may be stored, in all other cases only the
real part is stored):

<ul>
<li>CEEQ [PE]: equivalent creep strain (is converted internally into PEEQ
  since the viscoplastic theory does not distinguish between the two;
  consequently, the user will find PEEQ in the frd file, not CEEQ)
</li>
<li>E [TOSTRAIN (real),TOSTRAII (imaginary)]: strain. This is the total Lagrangian strain for (hyper)elastic
materials and incremental plasticity and the total Eulerian strain for deformation plasticity.
</li>
<li>ECD [CURR]: electrical current density. This only applies to electromagnetic calculations.
</li>
<li>EMFB [EMFB]: Magnetic field. This only applies to electromagnetic calculations.
</li>
<li>EMFE [EMFE]: Electric field. This only applies to electromagnetic calculations.
</li>
<li>ENER [ENER]: the energy density.
</li>
<li>ERR [ERROR (real), ERRORI (imaginary)]: error estimator for structural calculations (cf. Section <a href="node208.html#errorestimators">6.12</a>). Notice that ERR and ZZS
  are mutually exclusive.
</li>
<li>HER [HERROR (real), HERRORI (imaginary)]: error estimator for heat transfer calculations(cf. Section
  <a href="node208.html#errorestimators">6.12</a>). 
</li>
<li>HFL [FLUX]: heat flux in structures. 
</li>
<li>HFLF [FLUX]: heat flux in CFD-calculations. 
</li>
<li>MAXE [MSTRAIN]: maximum of the absolute value of the worst principal strain at all times for
  <a href="node276.html#frequency">*FREQUENCY</a> calculations with cyclic symmetry. It is
  stored for nodes belonging to the node set with name STRAINDOMAIN. This node
  set must have been defined by the user with the <a href="node310.html#nset">*NSET</a> command. The worst principal strain is the maximum of the
  absolute value of the principal strains times its original sign.
</li>
<li>MAXS [MSTRESS]: maximum of the absolute value of the worst principal stress at all times for
  <a href="node276.html#frequency">*FREQUENCY</a> calculations with cyclic symmetry. It is
  stored for nodes belonging to the node set with name STRESSDOMAIN. This node
  set must have been defined by the user with the <a href="node310.html#nset">*NSET</a> command. The worst principal stress is the maximum of the
  absolute value of the principal stresses times its original sign.
</li>
<li>ME [MESTRAIN (real), MESTRAII (imaginary)]: strain. This is the mechanical  Lagrangian strain for (hyper)elastic
materials and incremental plasticity and the mechanical Eulerian strain for
deformation plasticity (mechanical strain = total strain - thermal strain).
</li>
<li>PEEQ [PE]: equivalent plastic strain.
</li>
<li>PHS [PSTRESS]: stress: magnitude and phase (only for <a href="node332.html#steadystatedynamics">*STEADY
  STATE DYNAMICS</a> calculations and
<a href="node276.html#frequency">*FREQUENCY</a> calculations with cyclic symmetry).
</li>
<li>S [STRESS (real), STRESSI (imaginary)]: true (Cauchy) stress in structures. For beam elements this tensor is replaced
  by the section forces if SECTION FORCES is selected. Selection of S
  automatically triggers output of the error estimator ERR, unless NOE is
  selected after S (either immediately following S, or with some other output
  requests in between, irrespective whether these output requests are on the
  same keyword card or on different keyword cards).
</li>
<li>SF [STRESS]: total stress in CFD-calculations. 
</li>
<li>SMID [STRMID]: true (Cauchy) stress at the midsurface of a shell. This can
  only be used for shell elements which have been defined as user
  elements. It cannot be used of shell elements the label of which starts with
  S, since these are expanded into volumetric elements. 
</li>
<li>SNEG [STRNEG]: true (Cauchy) stress at the negative surface of a shell. This can
  only be used for shell elements which have been defined as user
  elements. It cannot be used of shell elements the label of which starts with
  S, since these are expanded into volumetric elements.
</li>
<li>SPOS [STRPOS]: true (Cauchy) stress at the positive surface of a shell. This can
  only be used for shell elements which have been defined as user
  elements. It cannot be used of shell elements the label of which starts with
  S, since these are expanded into volumetric elements. 
</li>
<li>SVF [VSTRES]: viscous stress in CFD-calculations. 
</li>
<li>SDV [SDV]: the internal state variables.
</li>
<li>THE [THSTRAIN]: strain. This is the thermal strain calculated by
  subtracting the mechanical strain (extrapolated to the nodes) from the total
  strain (extrapolated to the nodes) at the nodes. Selection of THE 
  triggers the selection of E and ME. This is needed to ensure that E (the
  total strain) and ME (the mechanical strain) are extrapolated to the nodes.
</li>
<li>ZZS [ZZSTR (real), ZZSTRI (imaginary)]: Zienkiewicz-Zhu improved stress  [<a href="node504.html#Zienkiewiczzhu1">100</a>],
  [<a href="node504.html#Zienkiewiczzhu2">101</a>](cf. Section <a href="node208.html#errorestimators">6.12</a>). Notice that ZZS
  and ERR are mutually exclusive.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The selected variables are stored for the complete model. Due to the averaging process jumps at
material interfaces are smeared out unless you model the materials on
both sides of the interface independently and connect the coinciding
nodes with MPC's.

<p>
For frequency calculations with cyclic symmetry the eigenmodes are generated
in pairs (different by a phase shift of 90 degrees). Only the first one of
each pair is stored in the frd file. If S is selected (the stresses) two
load cases are stored in the frd file: a loadcase labeled STRESS
containing the real part of the stresses and a loadcase labeled STRESSI
containing the imaginary part of the stresses. For all other variables only
the real part is stored.

<p>
The key ENER triggers the calculation of the internal energy. If it is
absent no internal energy is calculated. Since in nonlinear
calculations the internal energy at any time depends on the
accumulated energy at all previous times, the selection of ENER in
nonlinear calculations (geometric or material nonlinearities) must
be made in the first step.

<p>
The first occurrence of an *EL FILE keyword card within a step wipes
out all previous element variable selections for file output. If no
*EL FILE card is used within a step the selections of the previous
step apply. If there is no previous step, no element variables will be stored.

<p>
There are ten optional parameters: FREQUENCY, FREQUENCYF, GLOBAL, OUTPUT,
OUTPUT ALL,
SECTION FORCES, TIME POINTS, NSET, LAST ITERATIONS and CONTACT ELEMENTS. The parameters FREQUENCY and TIME POINTS are mutually exclusive. 

<p>
FREQUENCY applies to
nonlinear calculations where a step can consist of several
increments. Default is FREQUENCY=1, which indicates that the results
of all increments will be stored. FREQUENCY=N with N an integer
indicates that the results of every Nth increment will be stored. The
final results of a step are always stored. If you only want the final
results, choose N very big. 
The value of N applies to 
<a href="node313.html#output">*OUTPUT</a>,<a href="node264.html#elementoutput">*ELEMENT OUTPUT</a>, 
<a href="#elfile">*EL FILE</a>, <a href="node266.html#elprint">*ELPRINT</a>, 
<a href="node307.html#nodeoutput">*NODE OUTPUT</a>,
<a href="node306.html#nodefile">*NODE FILE</a>, <a href="node308.html#nodeprint">*NODE PRINT</a>,
<a href="node323.html#sectionprint">*SECTION PRINT</a> ,<a href="node235.html#contactoutput">*CONTACT OUTPUT</a>,
<a href="node234.html#contactfile">*CONTACT FILE</a> and <a href="node237.html#contactprint">*CONTACT PRINT</a>. 
If the FREQUENCY parameter is used
for more than one of these keywords with conflicting values of N, the
last value applies to all. A frequency parameter stays active across several steps
until it is overwritten by another FREQUENCY value or the TIME POINTS
parameter.

<p>
The 3D fluid analogue of FREQUENCY is FREQUENCYF. In coupled calculations
FREQUENCY applies to the thermomechanical output, FREQUENCYF to the 3D fluid output.

<p>
With the parameter GLOBAL you tell the program whether you would like the
results in the global rectangular coordinate system or in the local element
system. If an <a href="node312.html#orientation">*ORIENTATION</a> card is applied to the element at stake, this card defines
the local system. If no *ORIENTATION card is applied to the
element, the local system coincides with the global rectangular
system unless for shell elements, for which a local system is automatically
defined by default (cf. Section <a href="node41.html#S8">6.2.14</a>). Default value for the GLOBAL parameter is GLOBAL=YES,
which means that the results are stored in the global system (the only
exception to this is for the shell stresses SNEG, SMID and SPOS, which are
always stored in the shell local system). If you prefer the
results in the local system, specify GLOBAL=NO.

<p>
The parameter OUTPUT can take the value 2D or 3D. This has only
effect for 1d and 2d elements such as beams, shells, plane stress, plane
strain and axisymmetric elements AND provided it is used in the first step. If
OUTPUT=3D, the 1d and 2d elements are stored in their expanded three-dimensional
form. In particular, the user has the advantage to see his/her 1d/2d elements
with their real thickness dimensions. However, the node numbers are new and do
not relate to the node numbers in the input deck. Once selected, this
parameter is active in the complete calculation. If OUTPUT=2D the fields in the expanded elements are averaged to obtain
the values in the nodes of the original 1d and 2d elements. In particular,
averaging removes the bending stresses in beams and
shells. Therefore, default for beams
and shells is OUTPUT=3D, for plane stress, plane strain and axisymmetric
elements it is OUTPUT=2D. If OUTPUT=3D is selected, the parameter NSET is deactivated.

<p>
The parameter OUTPUT ALL specifies that the data has to be stored for all
nodes, including those belonging to elements which have been
deactivated. Default is storage for nodes belonging to active elements only.

<p>
The selection of SECTION FORCES makes sense for beam elements
only. Furthermore, SECTION FORCES and OUTPUT=3D are mutually exclusive (if
both are used the last prevails). If
selected, the stresses in the beam nodes are replaced by the section
forces. They are calculated in a local coordinate system consisting of the
1-direction <!-- MATH
 $\mathbf{n_1}$
 -->
<span class="MATH"><b><img align="MIDDLE" alt="$ \mathbf{n_1}$" border="0" height="29" src="img290.png" width="22"/></b></span>, the 2-direction <!-- MATH
 $\mathbf{n_2}$
 -->
<span class="MATH"><b><img align="MIDDLE" alt="$ \mathbf{n_2}$" border="0" height="29" src="img291.png" width="22"/></b></span> and 3-direction or
tangential direction <!-- MATH
 $\mathbf{t}$
 -->
<span class="MATH"><b><img align="BOTTOM" alt="$ \mathbf{t}$" border="0" height="13" src="img289.png" width="11"/></b></span> (Figure <a href="node60.html#c1d">74</a>). Accordingly, the stress components now have
the following meaning:

<p>
<ul>
<li>xx: Shear force in 1-direction 
</li>
<li>yy: Shear force in 2-direction
</li>
<li>zz: Normal force
</li>
<li>xy: Torque
</li>
<li>xz: Bending moment about the 2-direction
</li>
<li>yz: Bending moment about the 1-direction
</li>
</ul>
<p>
For all elements except the beam elements the parameter SECTION FORCES has no
effect. If SECTION FORCES is not selected the stress tensor is averaged across
the beam section. 

<p>
With the parameter TIME POINTS a time point sequence can be referenced,
defined by a 
<a href="node342.html#timepoints">*TIME POINTS</a> keyword. In that case, output will be
provided for all time points of the sequence within the step and additionally at the end of
the step. No other output will be stored and the FREQUENCY parameter is not
taken into account. Within a step only one time point sequence can be active. If more than
one is specified, the last one defined on any of the keyword cards
<a href="node306.html#nodefile">*NODE FILE</a>, <a href="#elfile">*EL FILE</a>, <a href="node308.html#nodeprint">*NODE
  PRINT</a> or <a href="node266.html#elprint">*EL PRINT</a> will be active. The TIME
POINTS option should not be used together with the DIRECT option on the
procedure card.  The TIME POINTS parameters stays active across several steps
until it is replaced by another TIME POINTS value or the FREQUENCY parameter.

<p>
The specification of a node set with the parameter NSET limits the output to
the nodes contained in the set. Remember that the frd file is node based, so
element results are also stored at the nodes after extrapolation from the
integration points. For cyclic symmetric structures the usage of the
parameter NGRAPH on the <a href="node245.html#cyclicsymmetrymodel">*CYCLIC SYMMETRY MODEL</a>
card leads to output of the results not only for the node set specified by the
user (which naturally belongs to the base sector) but also for all
corresponding nodes of the sectors generated by the NGRAPH parameter.  Notice
that for cyclic symmetric structures in modal dynamic and steady state
dynamics calculations the use of NSET is mandatory. In that case the stresses
will only be correct at those nodes belonging to elements for which ALL nodal
displacements were requested (e.g. by a *NODE FILE card).

<p>
The parameter LAST ITERATIONS leads to the storage of the
displacements in all iterations
of the last increment in a file with name ResultsForLastIterations.frd (can be opened with CalculiX GraphiX). This is
useful for debugging purposes in case of divergence. No such file is created if
this parameter is absent. 

<p>
Finally, the parameter CONTACT ELEMENTS  stores the contact elements which have
been generated in each iteration in a file with the name
jobname.cel. When
opening the frd file with CalculiX GraphiX these files can be read with the
command âread jobname.cel inpâ and visualized by
plotting the elements in the sets
contactelements_st<span class="MATH"><b><img align="BOTTOM" alt="$ \alpha$" border="0" height="14" src="img137.png" width="14"/></b></span>_in<span class="MATH"><b><img align="MIDDLE" alt="$ \beta$" border="0" height="30" src="img547.png" width="14"/></b></span>_at<span class="MATH"><b><img align="MIDDLE" alt="$ \gamma$" border="0" height="29" src="img891.png" width="13"/></b></span>_it<span class="MATH"><b><img align="BOTTOM" alt="$ \delta$" border="0" height="15" src="img892.png" width="11"/></b></span>, where <span class="MATH"><b><img align="BOTTOM" alt="$ \alpha$" border="0" height="14" src="img137.png" width="14"/></b></span>
is the step number, <span class="MATH"><b><img align="MIDDLE" alt="$ \beta$" border="0" height="30" src="img547.png" width="14"/></b></span> the increment number, <span class="MATH"><b><img align="MIDDLE" alt="$ \gamma$" border="0" height="29" src="img891.png" width="13"/></b></span> the attempt number
and <span class="MATH"><b><img align="BOTTOM" alt="$ \delta$" border="0" height="15" src="img892.png" width="11"/></b></span> the iteration number.

<p>
Starting with version 2.14 of CalculiX the selection of âSâ (stress)
automatically triggers the output the stress error estimator âERRâ as
well. This can only be avoided by selecting NOE in a position
after S (either immediately following S, or with some other output
requests in between, irrespective whether these output requests are on the same keyword card or on different keyword cards).
