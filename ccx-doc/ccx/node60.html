Three-node 3D beam element (B32 and B32R)
</h3>
<p>
In CalculiX this is the general purpose beam element. The node
numbering is shown in Figure <a href="#c1d3">73</a>.

<span class="MATH"><img align="MIDDLE" alt="$ \mathbf{n_2}$" border="0" height="29" src="img291.png" width="22"/></span> is a normalized

directions 1 and 2 are used to expand the beam element into a C3D20 or
C3D20R element according to Figure <a href="#c1d">74</a>.

</div>
<p>
For each node of the beam element 8 new nodes are generated according
to the scheme on the right of Figure <a href="#c1d">74</a>. These new nodes are
used in the definition of the brick element, and their position is
defined by the local directions together with the thickness and offset
in these directions. 

<p>
The tangential direction
follows from the geometry of the beam element. The normal direction
(2-direction) can be defined in two ways:

<p>
<ul>
<li>either by defining the normal explicitly by using  the <a href="node309.html#normal">*NORMAL</a> keyword card.
</li>
<li>if the normal is not defined by the *NORMAL card, it is defined
implicitly by <!-- MATH
 $\mathbf{n_2}=\mathbf{t}\times\mathbf{n_1}$
 -->
<span class="MATH"><img align="MIDDLE" alt="$ \mathbf{n_2}=\mathbf{t}\times\mathbf{n_1}$" border="0" height="29" src="img293.png" width="88"/></span>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In the latter case, <!-- MATH
 $\mathbf{n_1}$
 -->
<span class="MATH"><img align="MIDDLE" alt="$ \mathbf{n_1}$" border="0" height="29" src="img290.png" width="22"/></span> can be defined either

<p>
<ul>
<li>explicitly on the <a href="node215.html#beamsection">*BEAM SECTION</a> card.
</li>
<li>implicitly through the default of (0,0,-1).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If a node belongs to more than one beam element, the tangent and the
normal is first calculated for all elements to which the node belongs.
Then, the element with the lowest element number in
this set for which the normal was defined explicitly using a *NORMAL
card is  used as reference. Its normal and tangent are defined as
reference normal and reference tangent and the element is stored in a
new subset. All other elements of the same type in the set
for which the normal and tangent have an angle smaller than <span class="MATH"><img align="BOTTOM" alt="$ 0.5^\circ$" border="0" height="16" src="img270.png" width="31"/></span> with the
reference normal and tangent and
which have the same local thicknesses, offsets and sections are also included in this
subset. All elements in the subset are considered to have the same
normal and tangent. The normal is defined as the normed mean of all normals
in the subset, the same applies to the tangent. Finally, the normal is
slightly modified within the tangent-normal plane such that it is
normal to the tangent. This procedure is repeated until no elements
are left with an explicitly defined normal. Then, the element with the
lowest element number left in the set is used as reference. Its normal and tangent are defined as
reference normal and reference tangent and the element is stored in a
new subset. All other elements of the same type in the set
for which the normal and tangent have an angle smaller than <span class="MATH"><img align="BOTTOM" alt="$ 20^\circ$" border="0" height="16" src="img271.png" width="27"/></span> with the
reference normal and tangent and
which have the same local thicknesses, offsets and sections are also included in this
subset. All elements in the subset are considered to have the same
normal and tangent. This normal is defined as the normed mean of all normals
in the subset, the same applies to the tangent. Finally, the normal is
slightly modified within the tangent-normal plane such that it is
normal to the tangent. This procedure is repeated until
a normal and tangent have been defined in each element. Finally, the 1-direction is defined by
<!-- MATH
 $\mathbf{n_1}=\mathbf{n_2}\times\mathbf{t}$
 -->
<span class="MATH"><img align="MIDDLE" alt="$ \mathbf{n_1}=\mathbf{n_2}\times\mathbf{t}$" border="0" height="29" src="img294.png" width="88"/></span>. 

<p>
If this procedure leads to more than one local coordinate system in
one and the same node, all expanded nodes are considered to behave as
a knot with the generating node as reference node. Graphically, the beam
elements partially overlap (Figure <a href="#beam">75</a>).

<p>
<div align="CENTER"><a name="beam"></a><a name="14678"></a>

<caption align="BOTTOM"><strong>Figure 75:</strong>
Overlapping beam elements at a knot</caption>

</div>
<p>
Consequently, a node leads to a knot if 

<p>
<ul>
<li>the direction of the local normals in the elements participating
in the node differ beyond a given amount. Notice that this also applies to
neighboring elements having the inverse normal. Care should be taken
that the elements in beams  are oriented in a
consistent way to avoid the generation of knots. 
</li>
<li>several types of elements participate (e.g. shells and beams).
</li>
<li>the thickness is not the same in all participating elements.
</li>
<li>the offset is not the same in all participating elements.
</li>
<li>the section is not the same in all participating elements.
</li>
<li>a rotation or a moment is applied in the node (only for dynamic
calculations)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Similarly to shells applied rotations or moments (bending moments, torques) in
static calculations
are taken care of by the automatic generation of mean rotation MPC's.

<p>
Beam and shell elements are always connected in a
stiff way if they share common nodes. This, however, does not apply to
plane stress, plane strain and axisymmetric elements. Although any
mixture of 1D and 2D elements generates a knot, the knot is modeled
as a hinge for any plane stress, plane strain or axisymmetric elements
involved in the knot. This is necessary to account for the special
nature of these elements (the displacement normal to the symmetry
plane and normal to the radial planes is zero for plane elements and
axisymmetric elements, respectively).

<p>
The section of the beam must be specified on the <a href="node215.html#beamsection">*BEAM
SECTION</a> keyword card. It can be rectangular
(SECTION=RECT), elliptical (SECTION=CIRC), pipe-like (SECTION=PIPE) or
box-like (SECTION=BOX). A circular cross section
is a special case of elliptical section, pipe and box sections are special
cases of a rectangular cross section obtained through appropriate integration
point schemes. For a rectangular cross
section the local axes must be defined parallel to the sides of the
section, for an elliptical section they are parallel to the minor and
major axes of the section. The thickness of a section is the distance
between the free surfaces, i.e. for a circular section it is the
diameter. 

<p>
The thicknesses of the beam element (in 1- and 2-direction) can be defined on the
<a href="node215.html#beamsection">*BEAM SECTION</a> keyword card. It applies to the
complete element. Alternatively, the nodal thicknesses can be defined in each node
separately using <a href="node304.html#nodalthickness">*NODAL
THICKNESS</a>. That way, a beam with variable thickness
can be modeled. Thicknesses defined by a *NODAL THICKNESS card take
precedence over thicknesses defined by a *BEAM SECTION card.

<p>
The offsets of a beam element (in 1- and 2-direction) can be set on the <a href="node215.html#beamsection">*BEAM
SECTION</a> card. Default is zero. The unit of the offset
is the beam thickness in the appropriate direction. An offset of 0.5 means that the user-defined
beam reference line lies in reality on the positive surface of the
expanded beam (i.e. the surface with an external normal in direction of the local axis). The offset can take any real value. Consequently, it can be
used to define composite structures, such as a plate supported by a
beam, or a I cross section built up of rectangular cross sections. 

<p>
The treatment of the boundary conditions for beam elements is
straightforward. The user can independently fix any translational
degree of freedom (DOF 1 through 3) or any rotational DOF (DOF 4
through 6). Here, DOF 4 is the rotation about the global x-axis, DOF 5
about the global y-axis and DOF 6 about the global z-axis. No local
coordinate system should be defined in nodes with constrained
rotational degrees of freedom. A hinge is defined by fixing the
translational degrees of freedom only.

<p>
For an
internal hinge between 1D or 2D elements the nodes must be doubled
and connected with MPC's. The connection between 3D elements and all
other elements (1D or 2D) is always hinged.

<p>
Point forces defined in a beam node are not modified if a knot
is generated (the reference node is the beam node). If no knot is
generated, the point load is divided among the expanded nodes
according to a 1/4-1/4-1/4-1/4 ratio for a beam mid-node and a
(-1/12)-(1/3)-(-1/12)-(1/3)-(-1/12)-(1/3)-(-1/12)-(1/3)
ratio for a beam end-node. Concentrated bending moments or torques are
defined as point loads (<a href="node229.html#cload">*CLOAD</a>) acting on degree four
to six in the node. Their use generates a knot in the node.

<p>
Distributed loading can be defined by the labels P1 and P2 in the
<a href="node257.html#dload">*DLOAD</a> card. A positive value corresponds to a
pressure load in direction 1 and 2, respectively. 

<p>
In addition to a temperature for the reference surface of the beam, a
temperature gradient in 1-direction and in 2-direction can be specified on the
<a href="node340.html#temperature">*TEMPERATURE</a>. Default is zero.

<p>
Concerning the output, nodal quantities requested by the keyword
<a href="node308.html#nodeprint">*NODE PRINT</a> are stored in the beam nodes. They are obtained by averaging the nodal values of the
expanded element. For instance, the value in local beam node 1 are obtained
by averaging the nodal value of expanded nodes 1, 4, 5 and 8. Similar relationships
apply to the other nodes:

<p>
<ul>
<li>beam node 1 = average of expanded nodes 1,4,5 and 8
</li>
<li>beam node 2 = average of expanded nodes 9,11,13 and 15
</li>
<li>beam node 3 = average of expanded nodes 2,3,6 and 7
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Element quantities, requested by <a href="node266.html#elprint">*EL PRINT</a> are stored in
the integration points of the expanded elements.

<p>
Default storage for quantities requested by the <a href="node306.html#nodefile">*NODE FILE</a>
and <a href="node265.html#elfile">*EL FILE</a> is in the expanded nodes. This has the
advantage that the true three-dimensional results can be viewed in the
expanded structure, however, the nodal numbering is different from the beam
nodes. By using the OUTPUT=2D
parameter in the first step one can trigger the storage in the original beam
nodes. The same averaging
procedure applies as for the *NODE PRINT command. Section forces can be requested
by means of the parameter SECTION FORCES. If
selected, the stresses in the beam nodes are replaced by the section
forces. They are calculated in a local coordinate system consisting of the
1-direction <!-- MATH
 $\mathbf{n_1}$
 -->
<span class="MATH"><img align="MIDDLE" alt="$ \mathbf{n_1}$" border="0" height="29" src="img290.png" width="22"/></span>, the 2-direction <!-- MATH
 $\mathbf{n_2}$
 -->
<span class="MATH"><img align="MIDDLE" alt="$ \mathbf{n_2}$" border="0" height="29" src="img291.png" width="22"/></span> and 3-direction or
tangential direction <!-- MATH
 $\mathbf{t}$
 -->
<span class="MATH"><img align="BOTTOM" alt="$ \mathbf{t}$" border="0" height="13" src="img289.png" width="11"/></span> (Figure <a href="#c1d">74</a>). Accordingly, the stress components now have
the following meaning:

<p>
<ul>
<li>xx: Shear force in 1-direction 
</li>
<li>yy: Shear force in 2-direction
</li>
<li>zz: Normal force
</li>
<li>xy: Torque
</li>
<li>xz: Bending moment about the 2-direction
</li>
<li>yz: Bending moment about the 1-direction
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The section forces are calculated by a numerical integration of the stresses over the
cross section. To this end the stress tensor is needed at the integration
points of the cross section. It is determined from the stress tensors at the
nodes belonging to the cross section by use of the shape functions. Therefore,
if the section forces look wrong, look at the stresses in the expanded beams
(omitting the SECTION FORCES and OUTPUT=2D parameter).

<p>
For all elements different from beam elements the parameter SECTION FORCES has no
effect.

<p>
In thin structures two words of caution are due: the first is  with respect to
reduced integration. If the aspect ratio of the shells is very large (slender
shells) reduced integration will give you far better results than full
integration. In order to avoid hourglassing a 2x5x5 Gauss-Kronrod integration scheme is used
for B32R-elements with a rectangular cross section. This scheme contains the
classical Gauss scheme with reduced integration as a subset. The integration point
numbering is shown in Figure <a href="#gausskronrod">76</a>. For circular cross sections
the regular reduced Gauss scheme is used. In the rare cases that hourglassing
occurs the user might want to use full integration with smaller elements.
 Secondly, thin structures can easily
exhibit large strains and/or rotations. Therefore, most calculations require
the use of the NLGEOM parameter on the <a href="node333.html#step">*STEP</a> card.
