Steady state dynamics</a>
</h3>
<p>
In a steady state dynamics analysis, triggered by the <a href="node332.html#steadystatedynamics">*STEADY STATE
  DYNAMICS</a> key word, the response of the structure to
  dynamic harmonic
loading is assumed to be a linear combination of the lowest eigenmodes. This
  is very similar to the modal dynamics procedure, except that the load is
  harmonic in nature and that only the steady state response is of interest. The
eigenmodes are recovered from a file "problem.eig", where "problem" stands for
the name of the structure. These eigenmodes must have been determined in a
previous step (STORAGE=YES on the *FREQUENCY card or on the *HEAT
  TRANSFER,FREQUENCY card), either in the same input deck, or in an input deck run
previously. The dynamic harmonic loading is defined by its amplitude using the
  usual keyword cards such as <a href="node229.html#cload">*CLOAD</a> and a frequency interval
  specified underneath the *STEADY STATE DYNAMICS card. The load amplitudes
  can be modified
by means of a <a href="node213.html#amplitude">*AMPLITUDE</a> key word, which is interpreted
  as load factor versus frequency (instead of versus time). 

<p>
If centrifugal loading (cf. <a href="node257.html#dload">*DLOAD</a>) is found, it is assumed
that the complete calculation (eigenmode calculation inclusive) has been
performed in a relative coordinate system attached to the rotating
structure. The centrifugal loading is kept fixed and is not subject to the
harmonic excitation. Coriolis forces are activated for any part subject to
centrifugal loading. The resulting response (displacements, stresses etc.)
from the steady state calculation is in the rotating (relative) system,
without the static centrifugal part. 

<p>
The displacement
boundary conditions in a modal dynamic analysis should match zero boundary
  conditions in the same nodes and same directions in the step used for the
  determination of the eigenmodes. They can be defined using
  <a href="node216.html#boundary">*BOUNDARY</a> cards or <a href="node214.html#basemotion">*BASE MOTION</a>
  cards. The latter can also be used to define an acceleration.
 Temperature loading or residual stresses are not allowed. If such loading
  arises, the direct integration dynamics procedure should be used.

<p>
One can define loading which is shifted by <span class="MATH"><b><img align="BOTTOM" alt="$ 90 ^\circ$" border="0" height="16" src="img623.png" width="27"/></b></span> by using the parameter
LOAD CASE = 2 on the loading cards (e.g. <a href="node229.html#cload">*CLOAD</a>).

<p>
The frequency range is specified by its lower and upper bound. The number of data
points within this range <span class="MATH"><b><img align="BOTTOM" alt="$ n$" border="0" height="14" src="img656.png" width="13"/></b></span> can also be defined by the user. If
no eigenvalues occur within the specified range, this is the total number of
data points taken, i.e. including the lower frequency bound and the
upper frequency bound. If one or more eigenvalues fall within the specified range, <span class="MATH"><b><img align="MIDDLE" alt="$ n-2$" border="0" height="29" src="img1292.png" width="41"/></b></span>
points are taken in between the lower frequency bound and the lowest eigenfrequency
in the range, <span class="MATH"><b><img align="MIDDLE" alt="$ n-2$" border="0" height="29" src="img1292.png" width="41"/></b></span> between any subsequent eigenfrequencies in the range and
<span class="MATH"><b><img align="MIDDLE" alt="$ n-2$" border="0" height="29" src="img1292.png" width="41"/></b></span> points in between the highest eigenfrequency in the range and the upper
frequency bound. In addition, the eigenfrequencies are also included in the
data points. Consequently, if <span class="MATH"><b><img align="BOTTOM" alt="$ m$" border="0" height="14" src="img183.png" width="18"/></b></span> eigenfrequencies belong to the specified
range, <!-- MATH
 $(m+1)(n-2)+m+2=nm-m+n$
 -->
<span class="MATH"><b><img align="MIDDLE" alt="$ (m+1)(n-2)+m+2=nm-m+n$" border="0" height="31" src="img1293.png" width="275"/></b></span> data points are taken. They are equally spaced
in between the fixed points (lower frequency bound, upper frequency bound and
eigenfrequencies) if the user specifies a bias equal to 1. If a different bias
is specified, the data points are concentrated about the fixed points.

<p>
The following damping options are available:

<ul>
<li>Rayleigh damping by means of the <a href="node298.html#modaldamping">*MODAL DAMPING</a>
  key card. It assumes the damping matrix to be a linear combination of the
  problem's stiffness matrix and mass matrix. This splits the problem
  according to its eigenmodes, and leads to ordinary differential equations. 
</li>
<li>Direct damping by means of the <a href="node298.html#modaldamping">*MODAL DAMPING</a>
  key card. The damping coefficient <span class="MATH"><b><img align="MIDDLE" alt="$ \zeta$" border="0" height="30" src="img340.png" width="12"/></b></span> can be given for each mode
  separately. 
</li>
<li>Structural damping by means of the <a href="node246.html#damping">*DAMPING</a>
  key card. The structural damping is a material characteristic and has to be
  specified as such underneath a *MATERIAL card.
</li>
<li>Dashpot damping by defining dashpot elements (cf. Section
  <a href="node66.html#dashpota">6.2.39</a>).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
For nonharmonic loading, triggered by the parameter HARMONIC=NO on the *STEADY
STATE DYNAMICS card, the loading across one period is not harmonic and has
to be specified in the time domain. To this end the user can specify the
starting time and the final time of one period and describe the loading within
this period with *AMPLITUDE cards. Default is the interval <span class="MATH"><b><img align="MIDDLE" alt="$ [0.,1.]$" border="0" height="31" src="img1294.png" width="44"/></b></span> and step
loading. Notice that for nonharmonic loading the *AMPLITUDE cards describe
amplitude versus TIME. Internally, the nonharmonic loading is expanded into a
Fourier series. The user can specify the number of terms which should be used
for this expansion, default is 20. The remaining input is the same as for harmonic loading, i.e. the
user specifies a frequency range, the number of data points within this range
and the bias. The comments above for harmonic loading also apply here, except
that, since the loading is defined in the time domain, the LOAD CASE parameter
does not make sense here, i.e. LOAD CASE = 1 by default. 

<p>
A steady state dynamic analysis can also be performed for a cyclic symmetric
structure. To this end, the eigenmodes must have been determined for all
relevant modal diameters. For a cyclic steady state dynamic analysis the
following limiations apply:

<p>
<ol>
<li>Nonzero boundary conditions are not allowed.
</li>
<li>The displacements and velocities at the start of a step must be zero.
</li>
<li>Dashpot elements are not allowed.
</li>
<li>Structural damping is not allowed.
</li>
<li>If centrifugal forces apply, the corresponding Coriolis forces are not
  taken into account. The user has to assure that they are small enough so
  that they can be neglected.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
For cyclic symmetric structures the sector used in the corresponding
*FREQUENCY step is expanded into 360<span class="MATH"><b><img align="BOTTOM" alt="$ ^\circ$" border="0" height="16" src="img320.png" width="11"/></b></span> and the eigenmodes are rescaled
based on the mass of this expansion, i.e. they are divided by <span class="MATH"><b><img align="MIDDLE" alt="$ \sqrt{M}$" border="0" height="37" src="img1264.png" width="34"/></b></span> (for
nodal diameter 0 and M/2, the latter only if M is even) or <!-- MATH
 $\sqrt{M/2}$
 -->
<span class="MATH"><b><img align="MIDDLE" alt="$ \sqrt{M/2}$" border="0" height="38" src="img1265.png" width="52"/></b></span> (other
nodal diameters). M is the number of bases sectors in  360<span class="MATH"><b><img align="BOTTOM" alt="$ ^\circ$" border="0" height="16" src="img320.png" width="11"/></b></span>.

<p>
The output of a steady state dynamics calculation is complex, i.e. it consists
of a real and an imaginary part. Consequently, if the user saves the
displacements to file, there will be two entries: first the real part of the
displacement, then the imaginary part. This also applies to all other output
variables such as temperature or stress. For the displacements, the
temperatures and the stresses the user can request that these variables are stored as magnitude
and phase (in that order) by selecting beneath the <a href="node306.html#nodefile">*NODE
  FILE</a> card PU, PNT and PHS
instead of U, NT and S respectively. This does not apply to the *NODE PRINT card. 

<p>
Special caution has to be applied if 1D and 2D elements are used. Since
these elements are internally expanded into 3D elements, the application of
boundary conditions and point forces to nodes requires the creation of
multiple point constraints linking the original nodes to their expanded
counterparts. These MPC's change the structure of the stiffness and mass
matrix. However, the stiffness and mass matrix is stored in the .eig file in the *FREQUENCY
step preceding the *STEADY STATE DYNAMICS step. This is necessary, since the mass
matrix is needed for the treatment of the initial conditions ([<a href="node504.html#Dhondt">19</a>])
and the stiffness matrix for taking nonzero boundary conditions into
account. Summarizing, the *STEADY STATE DYNAMICS step should not introduce point loads
or nonzero boundary conditions in nodes in which no point force or boundary
condition was defined in the *FREQUENCY step. The value of the point force and
boundary conditions in the *FREQUENCY step can be set to zero. An example for
the application of point forces to shells is given in shellf.inp of the test
example set.
