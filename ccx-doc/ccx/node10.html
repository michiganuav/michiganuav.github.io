This problem involves a thermal calculation of the furnace depicted in
Figure <a href="#furngeo">14</a>. The furnace consists of a bottom plate at a temperature
<span class="MATH"><img align="BOTTOM" alt="$ Tb$" border="0" height="15" src="img102.png" width="22"/></span>, which is prescribed. It changes linearly in an extremely short time from
300 K to 1000 K after which it remains constant. The side walls of the furnace
are isolated from the outer world, but exchange heat through radiation with
the other walls of the furnace. The emissivity of the side walls and bottom
is <!-- MATH
 $\epsilon=1$
 -->
<span class="MATH"><img align="BOTTOM" alt="$ \epsilon=1$" border="0" height="14" src="img103.png" width="39"/></span>. The top of the furnace exchanges heat through radiation with
the other walls and with the environmental temperature which is fixed at 300
K. The emissivity of the top is <!-- MATH
 $\epsilon=0.8$
 -->
<span class="MATH"><img align="BOTTOM" alt="$ \epsilon=0.8$" border="0" height="14" src="img104.png" width="52"/></span>. Furthermore, the top exchanges
heat through convection with a fluid (air) moving at the constant rate of
0.001 kg/s. The temperature of the fluid at the right upper corner is 300
K. The walls of the oven are made of 10 cm steel. The material
constants for steels are: heat conductivity <!-- MATH

<p>
The input deck is listed above. It starts with the node
definitions. The highest node number in the structure is 602. The nodes 603 up
to 608 are fluid nodes, i.e. in the fluid extra nodes were defined (z=0.3
corresponds with the top of the furnace, z=0 with the bottom). Fluid node 603
corresponds to the location where the fluid temperature is 300 K (“inlet”),
node 608 corresponds to the “outlet”, the other nodes are located in
between. The coordinates of the fluid nodes actually do not enter the
calculations. Only the convective definitions with the keyword *FILM
govern the exchange between furnace and fluid. With the *ELEMENT card the
6-node shell elements making up the furnace walls are defined. Furthermore,
the fluid nodes are also assigned to elements (element type D), 
so-called network elements. These elements are needed for the assignment of
material properties to the fluid. Indeed, traditionally material properties are
assigned to elements and not to nodes. Each network element consists of two end
nodes, in which the temperature is unknown, and a midside node, which is used
to define the mass flow rate through the element. The fluid nodes 603 up to 613 are
assigned to the network elements 301 up to 305. 

<p>
Next, two node sets are defined: GAS contains all fluid nodes, Ndown contains
all nodes on the bottom of the furnace.  

<p>
The *PHYSICAL CONSTANTS card is needed in
those analyses in which radiation plays a role. It defines absolute zero, here
0 since we work in Kelvin, and the Stefan Boltzmann constant. In the present
input deck SI units are used throughout. 

<p>
Next, the material constants for
STEEL are defined. For thermal analyses the conductivity, specific heat
and density must be defined. The *SHELL SECTION card assigns the STEEL
material to the element set FURNACE, defined by the *ELEMENT statement
before. It contains all elements belonging to the furnace. Furthermore, a
thickness of 0.01 m is assigned. 

<p>
The material constants for material GAS consist of the density and the
specific heat. These are the constants for the fluid. Conduction in the fluid
is not considered. The material GAS is assigned to element set EGAS
containing all network elements.

<p>
The *INITIAL CONDITIONS card defines an initial temperature of 300 K for all
nodes, i.e. furnace nodes AND fluid nodes. The *AMPLITUDE card defines a ramp
function starting at 0.3 at 0.0 and increasing linearly to 1.0 at 1.0. It will
be used to define the temperature boundary conditions at the bottom of the
furnace. This ends the model definition.

<p>
The first step describes the linear increase of the temperature boundary
condition between <span class="MATH"><img align="BOTTOM" alt="$ t=0$" border="0" height="14" src="img112.png" width="39"/></span> and <span class="MATH"><img align="BOTTOM" alt="$ t=1$" border="0" height="14" src="img114.png" width="39"/></span>. The INC=100 parameter on the *STEP card
allows for 100 increments in this step. The procedure is *HEAT TRANSFER,
i.e. we would like to perform a purely thermal analysis: the only unknowns are
the temperature and there are no mechanical unknowns (e.g. displacements). The
step time is 1., the initial increment size is 0.1. Both appear on the line
underneath the *HEAT TRANSFER card. The absence of the parameter STEADY STATE
on the *HEAT TRANSFER card indicates that this is a transient analysis.

<p>
Next come the temperature boundary conditions: the bottom plate of the furnace
is kept at 1000 K, but is modulated by amplitude A1. The result is that the
temperature boundary condition starts at 0.3 x 1000 = 300K and increases
linearly to reach 1000 K at t=1 s. The second boundary conditions specifies
that the temperature of (fluid) node 603 is kept at 300 K. This is the inlet
temperature. Notice that “11” is the temperature degree of freedom.

<p>
The mass flow rate in the fluid is defined with the *BOUNDARY card applied to
the first degree of freedom of the midside nodes of the network elements. The
first line tells us that the mass flow rate in (fluid)node 609 is 0.001. Node
609 is the midside node of network element 301. Since this rate is positive the fluid flows from node
603 towards node 604, i.e. from the first node of network element 301 to the
third node. The user must assure conservation of mass (this is
actually also checked by the program).

<p>
The first set of radiation boundary conditions specifies that the top face of
the bottom of the furnace radiates through cavity radiation with an emissivity
of 1 and an environment temperature of 1000 K. For cavity radiation the
environment temperature is used in case the viewfactor at some location does
not amount to 1. What is short of 1 radiates towards the environment. The
first number in each line is the element, the number in the label (the second
entry in each line) is the face of the element exposed to radiation. In
general, these lines are generated automatically in cgx (CalculiX GraphiX).

</div>
<p>
The second and third block define the internal cavity radiation in the
furnace for the top and the sides. The fourth block defines the radiation of
the top face of the top plate of the furnace towards the environment, which is
kept at 300 K. The emissivity of the top plate is 0.8.

<p>
Next come the film conditions. Forced convection is defined for the top face
of the top plate of the furnace with a convection coefficient <!-- MATH
 $h=25 \mathrm{W/mK}$
 -->
<span class="MATH"><img align="MIDDLE" alt="$ h=25 \mathrm{W/mK}$" border="0" height="31" src="img117.png" width="100"/></span>. The
first line underneath the *FILM keyword indicates that the second face of
element 51 interacts through forced convection with (fluid)node 604. The last
entry in this line is the convection coefficient. So for each face interacting
with the fluid an appropriate fluid node must be specified with which the
interaction takes place.

<p>
Finally, the *NODE FILE card makes sure that the temperature is stored in the
.frd file and the *NODE PRINT card takes care that the fluid temperature is
stored in the .dat file.

<p>
The complete input deck is part of the test examples of CalculiX (furnace.inp). For the
present analysis a second step was appended keeping the bottom temperature
constant for an additional 3000 seconds. 

<p>
What happens during the calculation? The walls and top of the furnace heat up
due to conduction in the walls and radiation from the bottom. However, the top
of the furnace also loses heat through radiation with the environment and
convection with the fluid. Due to the interaction with the fluid the temperature
is asymmetric: at the inlet the fluid is cool and the furnace will lose more
heat than at the outlet, where the temperature of the fluid is higher and the
temperature difference with the furnace is smaller. So due to convection we
expect a temperature increase from inlet to outlet. Due to conduction we
expect a temperature minimum in the middle of the top. Both effects are
superimposed. The temperature distribution at <!-- MATH
 $t=3001 \mathrm{s}$
 -->
<span class="MATH"><img align="BOTTOM" alt="$ t=3001 \mathrm{s}$" border="0" height="14" src="img118.png" width="69"/></span> is shown in
Figure <a href="#furntemp">15</a>. There is a temperature gradient from the bottom of the
furnace towards the top. At the top the temperature is indeed not
symmetric. This is also shown in Figure <a href="#furn2D">16</a>, where the temperature of
locations A, B, C, D and E is plotted as a function of time.

<p>
Notice that steady state conditions have not been reached yet. Also note that
2D elements (such as shell elements) are automatically expanded into 3D
elements with the right thickness. Therefore, the pictures, which were plotted
from within CalculiX GraphiX, show 3D elements.
