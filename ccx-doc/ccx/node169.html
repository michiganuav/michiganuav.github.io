Modal dynamic analysis</a>
</h3>
<p>
In a modal dynamic analysis, triggered by the <a href="node299.html#modaldynamic">*MODAL
  DYNAMIC</a> key word, the response of the structure to dynamic
loading is assumed to be a linear combination of the lowest eigenmodes. These
eigenmodes are recovered from a file "problem.eig", where "problem" stands for
the name of the structure. These eigenmodes must have been determined in a
previous step (STORAGE=YES on the *FREQUENCY card or on the *HEAT
  TRANSFER,FREQUENCY card), either in the same input deck, or in an input deck run
previously. The dynamic loading can be defined as a piecewise linear function
by means of the <a href="node213.html#amplitude">*AMPLITUDE</a> key word. Initial conditions
can be used for the displacement and the velocity field (cf. <a href="node290.html#initialconditions">*INITIAL
  CONDITIONS</a>). If the step is immediately preceded
by another *MODAL DYNAMIC step the displacement and velocity conditions at
the end of the previous step are taken as initial conditions for the present
step. This only applies in the absence of the PERTURBATION parameter. If the
present step is a perturbation step
(i.e. the parameter PERTURBATION was used in the aforegoing *FREQUENCY and the
present *MODAL DYNAMIC step) the initial
displacement field is taken to be zero. 

<p>
The displacement
boundary conditions in a modal dynamic analysis should match zero boundary
  conditions in the same nodes and same directions in the step used for the
  determination of the eigenmodes. This corresponds to what is called base
  motion in ABAQUS. A typical application for nonzero boundary conditions is
  the base motion of a building due to an earthquake. Notice that in a modal
  dynamic 
  analysis with base motion non-homogeneous multiple point constraints are not
  allowed. This applies in particular to single point constraints (boundary
  conditions) in a non-global coordinate system, such as a cylindrical
  coordinate system (defined by a
  <a href="node343.html#transform">*TRANSFORM</a> card). Indeed, boundary conditions in a
  local coordinate system are internally transformed into non-homogeneous
  multiple point constraints. Consequently, in a modal dynamic analysis
  boundary conditions must be defined in the global Cartesian coordinate
  system. 

<p>
Nonzero displacement boundary conditions in a modal dynamic analysis require
the calculation of the first and second order time derivatives (velocity and
acceleration) of the temporarily static solution induced by
them. Indeed, based on the nonzero displacement boundary conditions (without
any other loading) at time <span class="MATH"><b><img align="BOTTOM" alt="$ t$" border="0" height="14" src="img450.png" width="9"/></b></span> a static solution can be determined for that
time (that's
why the stiffness matrix is included in the .eig file). If the nonzero
displacement boundary conditions change with time, so will the induced static
solution. Now, the solution to the dynamic problem is assumed to be the sum of
this temporarily static solution and a linear combination of the lowest
eigenmodes. To determine the first and second order time derivatives of
the induced static solution, second order accurate finite difference schemes are
used based on the solution at times <!-- MATH
 $t-\Delta t$
 -->
<span class="MATH"><b><img align="MIDDLE" alt="$ t-\Delta t$" border="0" height="30" src="img1289.png" width="48"/></b></span>, <span class="MATH"><b><img align="BOTTOM" alt="$ t$" border="0" height="14" src="img450.png" width="9"/></b></span> and <!-- MATH
 $t+ \Delta t$
 -->
<span class="MATH"><b><img align="MIDDLE" alt="$ t+ \Delta t$" border="0" height="30" src="img1290.png" width="48"/></b></span>, where
<span class="MATH"><b><img align="BOTTOM" alt="$ \Delta t$" border="0" height="16" src="img1291.png" width="23"/></b></span> is the time increment in the modal dynamic step. At the start of a
modal dynamic analysis step the nonzero boundary conditions at the end of the
previous step are assumed to have reached steady state (velocity and
acceleration are zero). Nonzero displacement boundary conditions can by
applied by use of the <a href="node216.html#boundary">*BOUNDARY</a> card or the <a href="node214.html#basemotion">*BASE
  MOTION</a> card.

<p>
Temperature loading or residual stresses are not allowed. If such loading
  arises, the direct integration dynamics procedure should be used.

<p>
The following damping options are available:

<ul>
<li>Rayleigh damping by means of the <a href="node298.html#modaldamping">*MODAL DAMPING</a>
  key card. It assumes the damping matrix to be a linear combination of the
  problem's stiffness matrix and mass matrix. This splits the problem
  according to its eigenmodes, and leads to ordinary differential equations. The results are
exact for piecewise linear loading, apart from the inaccuracy due to the
finite number of eigenmodes.
</li>
<li>Direct damping by means of the <a href="node298.html#modaldamping">*MODAL DAMPING</a>
  key card. The damping coefficient <span class="MATH"><b><img align="MIDDLE" alt="$ \zeta$" border="0" height="30" src="img340.png" width="12"/></b></span> can be given for each mode
  separately.  The results are
exact for piecewise linear loading, apart from the inaccuracy due to the
finite number of eigenmodes.
</li>
<li>Dashpot damping by defining dashpot elements (cf. Section
  <a href="node66.html#dashpota">6.2.39</a>).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
A modal dynamic analysis can also be performed for a cyclic symmetric
structure. To this end, the eigenmodes must have been determined for all
relevant modal diameters. For a cyclic modal dynamic analysis there are two
limitations:

<p>
<ol>
<li>Nonzero boundary conditions are not allowed.
</li>
<li>The displacements and velocities at the start of a step must be zero.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
For cyclic symmetric structures the sector used in the corresponding
*FREQUENCY step is expanded into 360<span class="MATH"><b><img align="BOTTOM" alt="$ ^\circ$" border="0" height="16" src="img320.png" width="11"/></b></span> and the eigenmodes are rescaled
based on the mass of this expansion, i.e. they are divided by <span class="MATH"><b><img align="MIDDLE" alt="$ \sqrt{M}$" border="0" height="37" src="img1264.png" width="34"/></b></span> (for
nodal diameter 0 and M/2, the latter only if M is even) or <!-- MATH
 $\sqrt{M/2}$
 -->
<span class="MATH"><b><img align="MIDDLE" alt="$ \sqrt{M/2}$" border="0" height="38" src="img1265.png" width="52"/></b></span> (other
nodal diameters). M is the number of bases sectors in  360<span class="MATH"><b><img align="BOTTOM" alt="$ ^\circ$" border="0" height="16" src="img320.png" width="11"/></b></span>.

<p>
Special caution has to be applied if 1D and 2D elements are used. Since
these elements are internally expanded into 3D elements, the application of
boundary conditions and point forces to nodes requires the creation of
multiple point constraints linking the original nodes to their expanded
counterparts. These MPC's change the structure of the stiffness and mass
matrix. However, the stiffness and mass matrix is stored in the .eig file in the *FREQUENCY
step preceding the *MODAL DYNAMIC step. This is necessary, since the mass
matrix is needed for the treatment of the initial conditions ([<a href="node504.html#Dhondt">19</a>])
and the stiffness matrix for taking nonzero boundary conditions into
account. Summarizing, the *MODAL DYNAMIC step should not introduce point loads
or nonzero boundary conditions in nodes in which no point force or boundary
condition was defined in the *FREQUENCY step. The value of the point force and
boundary conditions in the *FREQUENCY step can be set to zero. An example for
the application of point forces to shells is given in shellf.inp of the test
example set.

<p>
Special effort was undertaken to increase the computational speed for modal
dynamic calculations. If time is an issue for
you, please take into account the following rules:

<p>
<ul>
<li>Time varying loads slow down the execution.
</li>
<li>Loads applied in many elements slow down execution. Together with the
  previous rule this means that e.g. a constantly changing centrifugal load is
  very detrimental to the performance of the calculation.
</li>
<li>Nonzero displacements, centrifugal loads and gravity loads involve
  load changes in the complete mesh and slow down execution.
</li>
<li>Point loads act very local and are good for the performance.
</li>
<li>Use the parameter NSET on the *NODE FILE and *EL FILE card to limit output to a small set of nodes in order
  to accelerate the execution. 
</li>
<li>Requesting element variables in the frd output slows down execution. So
  does requesting nodal forces, since these are derived from the stresses in
  the integration points. Limiting output to displacements (U) is very
  beneficial.
</li>
<li>Using the user subroutine cload.f (Section <a href="node359.html#usercload">8.4.2</a>) slows down the execution, since this
  routine provides the user with the forces in the nodes at stake.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Summarizing, maximal speed will be obtained by applying a constant point load
(Heaviside step function) in one node
and requesting the displacements only in that node.
