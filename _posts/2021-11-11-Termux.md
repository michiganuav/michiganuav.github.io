Sometimes you need to work on the go.  Termux provides a terminal
environment on your Android phone.

# Install

Termux is no longer releasing current versions on Google Play.  Hence,
first install [F-Droid](https://www.f-droid.org/).  Then search for
"termux" and install it!

You may want to follow the instructions and immediately install the additional repositories.  I recommend root-repo and x11-repo.

```console
~ $ pkg install root-repo
~ $ pkg install x11-repo
```

Then update and upgrade

```console
~ $ pkg update
~ $ pkg upgrade
```

Then install your most useful packages!

```console
~ $ pkg install git python emacs
```

Note as of 11/11/2021 the pip version that is installed is out of date and can be updated
```console
~ $ python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

Assuming you use python, a nice development environment that works on
the device is jupyter.  However,
[currently](https://github.com/zeromq/pyzmq/issues/1469) to do this it
is first necessary to add one additional library.  Also quite useful
is pandas.

```console
~ $ pkg install libzmq
```

```console
~ $ pip install jupyter
~ $ pip install pandas
```
