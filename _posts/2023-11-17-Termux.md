Sometimes you need to work on the go.  Termux provides a terminal
environment on your Android phone.  This is written for me, but others
made find it useful.

# Install termux

Termux is no longer releasing current versions on Google Play.  Hence,
first install [F-Droid](https://www.f-droid.org/).  Then search for
"termux" and install it!

Then update and upgrade to ensure you have the latest packages.
```console
pkg update
pkg upgrade
```

Some of the later packages (R) require x11 libraries.  Hence, simply install the termux recommended packages
```console
pkg install x11-repo
pkg install root-repo
apt autoremove
```

If you want termux, you likely want to grant it access to local storage:
```console
termux-setup-storage
```
The above must be done in the termux window, so the pop-up can be enabled.


## ssh access
You likely want ssh access:
```console
pkg install openssh
sshd
```

You likely want to bring over your ssh keys from your other machine:
```
scp user@host.com:.ssh/authorized_keys .ssh/.
sshd
```

# Other termux useful packages
Then install your most useful packages!

## Python
I use a significant number of python packages. Here are some that are typically desired:

### Jupyterlab

I want python including jupyterlab as well as other scientific python packages. A good repository for that is https://its-pointless.github.io

This sequence was required to satisfy some dependencies which otherwise wouldn't compile.

```console
pkg install git python emacs rsync rust binutils cmake build-essential make clang flang
curl -LO https://its-pointless.github.io/setup-pointless-repo.sh
bash setup-pointless-repo.sh
pip install ruamel.yaml==0.17.21
pkg install libandroid-spawn patchelf ninja 
pip install jupyter
pip install pgen 
```
<!--
## MATHLIB=m CFLAGS="-std=c89" pip install --global-option="-I/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/include/python3.11" LDFLAGS=-lpython3.11 pip install pandas scipy
-->

### Scipy, Pandas

An additional repository is necessary (for simplicity)
```console
pkg install tur-repo
pkg install python-numpy python-pandas python-scipy
```

### Plotly, plotly

```console
pkg install libjpeg-turbo
pip install sympy
pip install plotly
```

# Apache

Just in case you want to web serve:

```console
pkg install apache2
```

# R

As of the date of publication, the termux repo maintained version of r
(https://www.r-project.org/) does not work due to library linking and
consistencies. however, compilation is relatively straightforward
assuming the following is completed.

<!--
-->

```console
pkg install make clang openssl libcurl libicu libxml2 wget which

VERSION=4.3.2

wget https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-4/R-${VERSION}.tar.gz
tar xavf R-${VERSION}.tar.gz 
cd R-${VERSION}/

mkdir -p $PREFIX/local/R-${VERSION}
CFLAGS='-O2' CXXFLAGS='-O2' FFLAGS='-O2' LTCFLAGS='-g -O2' CC=clang CXX=clang++ OBJC=clang FC=flang-new ./configure --enable-R-shlib --prefix=$PREFIX/local/R-${VERSION} --with-x=no
make -j4
make install

echo export PATH=/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/local/R-${VERSION}/lib/R/bin:\$\{PATH\} >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
```

## Subsequently, install any necessary packages

Install some dependencies:

```console
pip install ambiance
pkg install libcairo xorgproto gdal
pkg install bthread-dev libcairo
pkg install pandoc
```

Prepare for compiling within R. (For some reason, on one of my
installations of termux, the local dictory was not in the include
path, hence it is added with this file.)

```console
mkdir R-packages
cd R-packages
mkdir ~/.R
cat << EOF >> .R/Makevars
PKG_LIBS+=-lbthread
CXXFLAGS+=-I.
CFLAGS+=-I.
EOF
```

There are a few R packages which are problematic and it is wise to
install these first.  First, get the patches. Originally they are
distributed from
[its-pointless](https://github.com/its-pointless/gcc_termux) however,
I had to update the patches are they are best downloaded from my own
fork (as of publication of this post).

```console
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gustafson/gcc_termux/master/R-patches/later-tincythread.h.patch
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gustafson/gcc_termux/master/R-patches/rcran-fs-Makevars.patch
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gustafson/gcc_termux/master/R-patches/rcran-fs-id.cc.patch


wget https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/fs_1.6.3.tar.gz
tar xavf fs_1.6.3.tar.gz
patch -p0 < rcran-fs-id.cc.patch
patch -p0 < rcran-fs-Makevars.patch

wget https://repo.miserver.it.umich.edu/cran/src/contrib/later_1.3.1.tar.gz
tar xavf later_1.3.1.tar.gz
patch -p0 < later-tincythread.h.patch
```

The launch R and install it those:

```r
install.packages("/data/data/com.termux/files/home/R-packages/fs", repos = NULL, type = "source")
install.packages("/data/data/com.termux/files/home/R-packages/later", repos = NULL, type = "source")
```

And then follow up with the remaining packages.  For example:
```r
install.packages("knitr")
install.packages("rmarkdown")
install.packages("bookdown")

install.packages("svglite")
install.packages("DT")
install.packages("reticulate")
install.packages("leaflet")
```

# Termux other stuff

```console
mkdir -p .termux/boot
echo "termux-wake-lock && sshd" >> ~/.termux/boot/start-sshd
apt install termux-api termux-services
```
